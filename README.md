# MH-Trailers (BETA)
- Transport all your vehicles with trailers. 
- Trailer rent shop build in.


# How it works
- Everyting works with the target eye.
- First you look with target to the trailer, then you get a few options, 
- fist use ramp down than use platform down, you can now put vehicles on the top of this platform, 
- then you lock the vehicles by looking to the trailer and use again the target, and then you can raise the platform.
- With this the all top vehicles will be locked automaticly.
- When you have raised the top platform, you can then use the lower platform.
- which it in this order and it should work fine.


# My trailers does not work
- Make sure you add the right trailer hash key in the config file
- same for the vehicles
- make sure all settings in the config are correct.

# NOTE for ignore vehicles.
- What this does is, it ignore the vehicle you tow the trailer with,
- if you don't add this vehicle hash in the ignore vehicle in the config file things does wrong and the truck will also be stuck on the trailer,
- so don't forget this part cause i'm not going to help you fixing your issues if you don't read this file.


# Adding new trailers
- Make sure you add all settings in the config file correctly.
- cause i'm not going to help adding more trailers, cause it's not that hard to do.
